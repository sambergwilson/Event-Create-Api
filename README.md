# Event-Create-Api

This is the beginning of a project I hope to use for an Event planner of some sort. 

# Technologies Used

 - C# Api
 - Swagger
 - Entity Framework
 - SQL

# Future Used Technologies (Hopefully)

 - Angular
 - React

The goal here is to have a better understanding of how to use API points to pass
data around using different frameworks. So I as a beginning developer can expand 
my knowledge on how to interact with multiple frameworks or front-end tools.
